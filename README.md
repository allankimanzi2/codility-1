An account's balance is empty at the beginning of the year(balance was 0), each transacion specifies the amount and date it was executed. If the amount is negative(less than 0) then it was a card payment,otherwuse it was an incoming transfer(amount at least 0). The date of each transaction is YYYY-MM-DD format. There is also a fee for having a card(omitted in the given transaction list) which is 5 per month. This fee is deducted from the account balance at the end month unless there were at least three payments made by card for a total cost of at least 100 within that month. Your task is to compute the final balance of the account at the end of the year 2020. Write a function: int solution(int A[], char *D[], int N); that given an array A of N integers representing transaction amounts of an array D of N strings representing transaction dates, returns the final balance of the account at the end of the year 2020. Transaction number K(for K within the range [0..N-1]) was executed on the date represented by D[K] for amount A[K]. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..100], each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000..1,000], D contains strings in YYYY-MM-DD format representing dates in the range 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.
